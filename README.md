# Flight Fare Prediction 

## Overview
Flight fares are highly dynamic and depend on various factors such as airline, source, destination, departure time, and duration. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict flight ticket prices using historical data.

## Problem Statement
Airline ticket prices fluctuate based on numerous variables like travel time, duration, airline brand, and holidays. Predicting fares in advance can help travelers save both money and time. The goal is to use machine learning to forecast flight ticket prices using structured historical data.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is publicly available on Kaggle:  
ðŸ”— [Flight Fare Prediction - Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh)

## Tech Stack and Tools
